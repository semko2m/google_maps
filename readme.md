# Laravel PHP Framework 

1). Freeze functionality. When you freeze markers than continue I would suggest to clear all markers and start again with pulling. 
I would build search functionality for user. In that case they can search and see results on map.

2) When click on map tag, goes on detail page with all detail about.

If I have three days I would try to build some complete service for user. They need to search some data, check details about them and then contact them.
